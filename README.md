## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vite-React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
  


### What I learned

For this one I tried a new way of creating a react app by using Vite. It is so fast and easy to use that I encourage anyone to try it.The complicated part was when I tried to deploy the app due to conflicting instructions, being used to deploy a react app using gh-pages by only applying a few settings to actually added new folders with instructions etc. Overall it was a good experience for me and I would recommend it.
